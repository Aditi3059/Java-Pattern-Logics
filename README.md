# Java-Pattern-Logics
Pattern printing exercises in Java to strengthen control structures, loops, and logical thinking.

This repository is a collection of *Java pattern programs* created as part of my Core Java learning journey at QSpiders.  
These programs may look simple, but they played a key role in strengthening my *logic-building, loop mastery, and problem-solving skills*.  

## ðŸ“Œ Patterns Implemented  
-  Star and pyramid structures  
-  Number-based patterns  
-  Alphabet patterns  
-  Diamond & mirror shapes  
-  Creative nested loop challenges  

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack  
- Language: Java (Core Java)  
- IDE: Eclipse  

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes  
- Mastery over *loops & conditionals*  
- Better *analytical thinking*  
- Stronger base for *advanced Java concepts & projects*
